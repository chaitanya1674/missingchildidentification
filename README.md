The ultimate goal of this system is to help reunite missing children with their families and loved ones as quickly as possible. By automating the process of identifying missing children, this system can help law enforcement agencies and other organizations save valuable time and resources in their efforts to locate missing children. Additionally, the system can provide a more accurate and objective means of identifying missing children compared to traditional methods, which rely heavily on human memory and perception.
